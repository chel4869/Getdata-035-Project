# Getdata-035-Project
This is the script for the course project of Getting and Cleaning Data. The origianl dataset is provided by UCI, and a full description of this dataset can be found at: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones 

The R script does following things:
 1. Find the measurements on the mean and standard deviation and also extract the needed feature names.
 2. Load the data and combine train and test dataset and rename the variables
 3. Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the dataset and label the data set with descriptive variable names.
 4. Create a second data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
 
The cleaned dataset is enclosed as the "data.txt" file.
